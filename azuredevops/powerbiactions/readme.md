Power BI Actions is a Build and Release Task for Azure Pipelines. With this tasks a couple of actions can be performed against PowerBI.com

Actions that can be performed with this extension are:
* Upload Power BI dashboard (pbix file).
* Create a Power BI workspace.
* Remove a Power BI workspace.
* Add a new Admin user to a Power BI workspace.
* Add a Service Principal to a Power BI workspace.
* Add a Group to a Power BI workspace.
* Update the connection of a Power BI report.
* Refresh a dataset.
* Update SQL Direct Query String

The task works with a "Power BI" service connection that needs to be configured within the "Service Connections" settings of the project. Within the latest version there are two types of service connections one for a connection with a Service Principal and one with a user:

### User

For the service connection to work as it should you need to configure the following parameters:

* ClientId: The client id of the native Azure Active Directory application. This application should have the appropriate rights in order to use the Power BI Api. To register an application, check the following URL: [Register an Azure AD app to embed Power BI content](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/register-app)
* Username: The username of the user that will perform the actions. Make sure the account does not have Multi Factor authentication enabled.
* Password: The password of the user.

**Note**: The user must have a Power BI Pro license in order to perform the tasks.

### Service Principal

To configure a Service Principal with PowerBI you will have to go through this guide:[Service principal with Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/embed-service-principal)

* ClientId: The client id of the Azure Active Directory application. This application should have the appropriate rights in order to use the Power BI Api.
* ClientSecret: The client secret of the application
* Tenant ID: The identifier of the Azure Active Directory tenant 

Depending on the action you choose within the task you need to supply the following parameters:
* Power BI service connection: The service connection that you have configured.
* Action: The actions that should be performed
* Workspace name: The name of the Power BI workspace
* Source File: The location of the Power BI file that needs to be published. The parameter can also be a search query "*.pbix".
* Overwrite: Checkbox for specifying if the Power BI report should be overwritten.
* Create: Create the Power BI workspace if it does not exist. 
* UpdateAll: Will update all datasets if checked.
* Dataset: The name of the dataset.
* Users: The users that should be added to the workspace (separated by ',')
* Service Principals: The users that should be added to the workspace (separated by ',')
* Groups : The group object Id that should be added to the workspace (separated by ',')
* Datasource type: The datasource type that needs to be changed within the dataset.
* Old Server: The server value that is specified in the existing connection.
* New Server: The server value for the new connection.
* Old Database: The database value that is specified in the existing connection.
* New Database: The database value for the new connection.
* Old Url: The URL value that is specified in the existing connection.
* New Url: The URL value for the new connection.

### Power BI Parameters
 
PowerBI introduced the use of Workspaces (groups) which can be used as Environment or a Department or a combination of both. Now PowerBI supports parameters to eliminate traditional hardcoded values in reports. For instance, Database Name & Database Servers differs for every environment. After publishing the reports from Azure Repos to Workspace, it is difficult to update the parameters manually. It is recommended to use a configuration file that is a collection of all parameters used across the reports for a specific Workspace.
 
* Step01: Create a JSON configuration similar to 'configParameters.json'
* Step02: Update the list of parameters and their values corresponding to respective environments
* Step03: Save and check-in the 'config' file to the Repository
* Step04: Use a FileCopy task to copy the file from Repository to the Staging Directory
* Step05: Publish the artifacts to Release Pipeline and map the JSON file in the Release Pipeline
 
Note:
    (1) The paramter name in PowerBI reports should match with the Parameter names specified in the config file.
    (2) For common variables, the names should be consistant with config file for all reports.
    
## Output

During the execution of the task different values will be placed inside variables:

* PowerBIActions.ReportId: The report Id of the uploaded report (only supported when uploading one report).
* PowerBIActions.WorkspaceId: The Id of the workspace.
